the quick brown fox jumps over dog
a journey of a thousand miles begins
to be or not to be that is question
all that glitters is not made of gold
practice makes perfect every time now
where there is a will there is a way
actions speak louder than words today
knowledge is power and power is might
every cloud has a silver lining here
fortune favors the bold and the brave
the pen is mightier than the sword is
curiosity killed the cat they all say
better late than never is what i say
time flies when you are having so fun
the early bird catches the worm daily
